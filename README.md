# YOLO-based-object-detection
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to share my YOLO-based object detection project with you. This is something I worked on from scratch, including training the model on a custom dataset to detect specific objects like hats and jackets.
What This Project Does âœ¨
Custom Object Detection: Detects hats and jackets with high accuracy.
Video and Image Support: Processes both images and videos for object detection.
Personalized Labels: The default class names are replaced with custom labels for a clear, human-readable output.
